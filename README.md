Sales Quantity Prediction Based on Advertising Media Investment
================


### Introduction:

Data was analyzed for a company that invested in television, radio, and
newspaper advertising. The scope of this project was to provide an
overview of the amounts that were spent on these different media and
also to use machine learning to predict the quantity sold of the
company’s product based on their advertising investment. The advertising
was done across 200 markets. The advertising expense was provided in
terms of thousands of dollars. The quantity of product sold was provided
in terms of thousands of units.

**Data Source:** Advertising dataset from [An Introduction to
Statistical
Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-first-edition).

**Business Problem:** To analyze how advertising media affected the
quantity sold of a product across markets. The goal of the project was
to provide the company with insights on how investment in television,
radio, and newspaper advertising influenced sales of their product.

#### The project was done using R and it consisted of two parts:

- **Part 1:** An Exploratory Data Analysis was performed in order to
  gain an understanding of how television, radio, and newspaper
  advertising affected the sales of the company’s product across
  different markets. An overview of the advertising expense was
  presented to support the company with planning and business strategy.

- **Part 2:** The Multiple Linear Regression machine learning algorithm
  was used to build models to predict the company’s sales, in terms of
  quantity of product sold, based on the amounts that the company had
  invested in the advertising media. The models were then evaluated
  using the Adjusted R-squared metric and the Root Mean Square Error
  (RMSE) metric to select the best model to provide the sales
  prediction. The company could then use the model to estimate the
  quantity of product they could expect to sell given the amounts that
  they planned to invest in the advertising media.

#### **Findings:**

- Television had the greatest range in the amount spent by the company
  for advertising across their markets.
- Advertising on television was considerably more expensive than the
  other two media.
- The newspaper advertising expense and radio advertising expense
  resulted in ranges that were similar to each other, with the exception
  of two newspaper outlier values.
